# MLM

A Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) platform utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end, and PHP for the backend can create a dynamic and interactive user experience. The HTML structure defines the layout and form elements, CSS styles enhance the visual presentation, and JavaScript adds client-side interactivity, such as form validation. PHP, as the backend language, manages server-side processes like handling form submissions, interacting with databases, and processing business logic related to the MLM structure, including commission calculations and user authentication. This tech stack enables the creation of a responsive and efficient MLM system where users can seamlessly interact with the platform, make transactions, and view their network hierarchy.
